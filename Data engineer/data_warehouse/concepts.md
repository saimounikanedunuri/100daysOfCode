ðŸ”¹ What is a Data Warehouse?
A centralized repository for storing large volumes of structured data from multiple sources, designed to support decision-making processes.
ðŸ”¹ Architecture of a Data Warehouse
Understanding the layers: Data Source, Staging, Data Storage, Data Presentation, and Metadata.
ðŸ”¹ Types of Data Warehouses
Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW), Operational Data Store (ODS), and Data Mart.
ðŸ”¹ Data Warehouse vs. Database
While databases are designed for day-to-day operations, data warehouses are optimized for analytical queries and reporting.
ðŸ”¹ ETL vs. ELT
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) define different approaches to handling data flow.
ðŸ”¹ Fact vs. Dimension Tables
Fact tables store quantitative data for analysis, while dimension tables provide context (e.g., time, location) to the facts.
ðŸ”¹ Star Schema vs. Snowflake Schema
Star schema is simpler with denormalized tables, whereas snowflake schema is more complex with normalized tables.
ðŸ”¹ Schema Design
Explored Star Schema, Snowflake Schema, and Fact Constellation Schema (Galaxy Schema).
ðŸ”¹ 4-Step Process to Create a Dimensional Model
Identify the business process, declare the grain, choose dimensions, and identify the facts.
ðŸ”¹ Delta Lake vs. Data Warehouse
Understanding how Delta Lake offers reliability and performance for big data processing in data lakes.
ðŸ”¹ Data Warehouse vs. Data Mart
Data marts are subsets of data warehouses, focusing on specific business lines or teams.
ðŸ”¹ Data Aggregation in Data Warehouses
Used to summarize data for efficient querying and reporting.
ðŸ”¹ Data Partitioning
Crucial for optimizing query performance by dividing large datasets into smaller, more manageable pieces.
ðŸ”¹ Types of Dimensions
Commonly recognized dimensions include Time, Geography, Product, and Organization.
