Workshop: Computer Vision Blueprint
step1:
4 object detection methods:
1. by color
Pros: 
. simple to implement
. Its reliable even with different shades of same color
Cons:
. the object you want to detect needs to have a unique color
. you need to calibrate the detection for each color you want to detect

2. by removing background
Pros:
. simple to implement
. reliable as long as the objects have a high contrast with the background
. (example, black objects on a white background)
Cons:
. background should be homogeneous
. Sensitive to environmental changes

3. by their movement
Pros:
. simple to implement, it doesnt require 
. great to detect movements in front of the camera
Cons:
. Camera needs to be stable, so so the background doesnt change
. it only works with videos and camera
. the object needs to be moving

4. detect any object with deep learning
Pros:
. the most reliable way to detect any object
. it also detect the object category(ex. laptop, notebook, cup,..)
. it works on any environment
Cons:
. requires longer time to prepare the detector
. it might need a powerful hardware to run in realtime

step2:
identify any custom object with deep learning
tools necessary:
1. framework
pytorch(maintained by facebook), tensorflow(by google), keras(independent), opencv(popular), darkner

2. object detection model
popular object detection models:
2014 - R-CNN
2016 - YOLO
2016 - SSD
2018 - YOLOv3
2020 - YOLOv4 (best version for object detection)
2021 - Scaled YOLOv4 (best version for object detection)

the 3 phases to identify objects with DL:
1. Prepare image dataset
gathering different types of images related to object 
different types, colors, sizes of object
how many: depends on scenario
Example of image dataset for 'helicopter'
#how to take datasets will say

2. image annotation
#what software we are going to use will say
example of manual annotation for 'camera'

3. training
example of training to detect 'helicopters'

software used in 'helicopter' example:
. makesense.ai
.
.

step3:
track your identified objects

object detection vs object training

how to track objects:

step4:
implement object detection & training together

example: CC TV camera
detect staff, customers
detect good/damaged object scrolling - upside down, position is correct, damage in color
animal count
crop
conveyor belt

overview of this workshop:
. The 4 steps to build a computer vision software to detect and track any object.

. Got a clear guidelines about what object detection is and its different methods, about object training and how finally build own project.
